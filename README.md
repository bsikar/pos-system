# pos-system

## About
pos-system is a simple implementation of a point of sale system, with a backend in Rust and a frontend in React. The system allows users to add items to a cart and then checkout, making it easy for businesses to process transactions quickly and accurately.

The goal of this project is to provide a more efficient alternative to relying on employees' memory to manually enter prices for goods. With pos-system, employees can simply press icons that represent items, reducing the likelihood of errors and increasing sales.

In addition to the core point of sale functionality, pos-system includes an admin panel that allows users to delete or alter database entries, and supports cash transactions for inclusion in the sale database.

## Documentation
Documentation for the pos-system is available at bsikar.github.io/pos-system/, including installation instructions and detailed usage documentation.

## Technologies
The project uses the following technologies:

* Backend: Rust
* Frontend: React
* Styling: SCSS
* Database: SQLite3
* Additional Languages: Python, TypeScript, Shell, HTML

## Inspiration
The idea for pos-system came from my experience working at a donut shop without a point of sale system. The time and effort required to train employees to manually enter prices inspired me to create a simple and easy-to-use POS system that businesses of any size can benefit from.
